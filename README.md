I developed a full-stack web app that has LinkedIn OAuth, saves users' profile data and posts to MongoDB, and has a cron job that automatically posts in the name of the user on LinkedIn. The flow is quite simple: the user registers with LinkedIn, completes an interview, and based on that, the AI will build an avatar. Further on, based on that avatar, AI will brainstorm post ideas for the user and write relevant posts for them. LinkedIn respects successful semantic structures that already have results for most of the influencers on LinkedIn.
